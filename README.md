# Unity-Projects [Lucas Varela Negro]
Projects that I have developed or that I am currently developing in my journey as a Game Developer.

### Game Jam games, personal projects and prototypes on my Itch.Io

## __Game developing course__

- I will slowly make a WebGL build for some of the projects made during the course, my main focus is to follow the course so the main plan
is to have all the builds as a reference of all I did during the course. [**Source code not public for academic purposes**]
