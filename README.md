# Unity-Projects [Lucas Varela Negro]
Projects that I developed or that I am currently developing in my journey as a Game Developer.

The projects with a ⭐ represent projects that I had dedicated more time than the usual.

## __Personal Projects__
- Here I will be referencing the personal projects that I develop during my free time.

### My first ever game prototype! ⭐⭐

## __Game developing course [Active]__

- I will slowly make a WebGL build for each of the projects made during the course, my main focus is to follow the course so the main plan
is to have all the builds as a reference of all I did during the course.
