## __Game developing course [Active]__

- I will slowly make a WebGL build for each of the projects made during the course, my main focus is to follow the course so the main plan
is to have all the builds as a reference of all I did during the course. [**Source code not public for educational purposes**]


### Ghost Apocalypse

(A lot of projects pending to be adapted to playable versions)

## __Unity Learn Projects (Unity Junior Programmer Pathway) [Projects pending to be adapted]__

I will add playable versions as WebGL builds of the examples made during the course once finished.
